# Spec Generator Instructions
Extract key technical details from the issue and organize them according to the following strict JSON schema.

### Critical Rules:
1. **Codebase Verification:** Rely on file paths and locations found during your codebase exploration. Ensure all files mentioned in `files_to_modify` actually exist in the repository. Do not make up file paths.
2. **Target File Selection:** List all source code files in `files_to_modify` where code changes belong.
   - Fix config or state issues early at their setup/hook entrypoint rather than refactoring low-level utilities.
   - Strictly do NOT list test files or files that were only inspected without requiring code changes.
3. **Strict JSON Escaping:** Ensure the generated output is standard, valid JSON. In JSON string values (such as summary fields or verification steps), do NOT escape single quotes with backslashes. Write them directly as `'` (not `\\'`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The output MUST strictly adhere to this schema. Deviations (like putting objects inside arrays instead of strings) will break the downstream automated code generation pipeline.

The final `workable_spec` object must conform strictly to this JSON Schema specification. Every field listed below is strictly required and must be populated:
